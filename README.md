## 🎯 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for banks, as acquiring new customers costs significantly more than retaining existing ones. This project develops a neural network-based classifier to predict whether a customer will leave the bank within the next 6 months, enabling proactive retention strategies.

### Key Objectives:
- Build a robust neural network classifier for churn prediction
- Maximize recall to minimize false negatives (missed churning customers)
- Provide actionable business insights for customer retention
- Compare different optimization techniques and model architectures

## 📊 Dataset

**Size:** 10,000 customers with 14 features

### Data Dictionary:
- **CustomerId:** Unique customer identifier
- **Surname:** Customer's last name
- **CreditScore:** Customer's credit history score
- **Geography:** Customer's location (France, Spain, Germany)
- **Gender:** Customer's gender
- **Age:** Customer's age
- **Tenure:** Years as bank customer
- **NumOfProducts:** Number of bank products owned
- **Balance:** Account balance
- **HasCrCard:** Credit card ownership (0/1)
- **EstimatedSalary:** Estimated annual salary
- **IsActiveMember:** Active usage of bank services (0/1)
- **Exited:** Target variable (0: Stayed, 1: Left)

### Key Dataset Characteristics:
- **Class Distribution:** 79.6% retained customers, 20.4% churned
- **No Missing Values:** Complete dataset with no null entries
- **Mixed Data Types:** Numerical and categorical features

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow 2.19.0, Keras 3.9.2
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Balancing:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Model Evaluation:** Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Python 3.12

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Final Optimized Model:
```python
Sequential([
    Dense(16, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
    Dropout(0.4),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dense(8, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
    Dropout(0.4),
    BatchNormalization(),
    Dense(2, activation='relu', kernel_initializer='he_normal'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

### Model Features:
- **Optimizer:** Adam with learning rate 0.0001
- **Regularization:** Dropout (40%) and Batch Normalization
- **Weight Initialization:** He Normal
- **Early Stopping:** Patience=5, monitoring validation recall
- **Class Balancing:** SMOTE oversampling

### Model Comparison Results:
| Model Configuration | F1-Score | Accuracy | Recall | Precision |
|-------------------|----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| SGD Basic | 0.025 | 0.801 | 0.012 | 0.833 |
| Adam Basic | 0.231 | 0.810 | 0.143 | 0.616 |
| **Adam + SMOTE** | **0.774** | **0.749** | **0.857** | **0.705** |
| Adam + SMOTE + Dropout + BN | 0.686 | 0.734 | 0.583 | 0.835 |

```

## 💻 Usage

1. **Data Exploration:**
```python
python src/data_exploration.py
```

2. **Train Model:**
```python
python src/train_model.py
```

3. **Make Predictions:**
```python
python src/predict.py --model-path models/best_model.h5 --data-path data/test.csv
```

4. **Run Full Pipeline:**
```python
python main.py
```

## 📈 Results

### Best Model Performance:
- **Training Recall:** 85.7% (Successfully identifies 857 out of 1000 churning customers)
- **Validation Recall:** 70.1% (Generalizes well to unseen data)
- **F1-Score:** 0.774 (Excellent balance between precision and recall)
- **Training Time:** ~42 seconds for 80 epochs

### Key Findings:
1. **SMOTE significantly improves recall** from 14.3% to 85.7%
2. **Adam optimizer outperforms SGD** across all metrics
3. **Class imbalance handling is crucial** for churn prediction
4. **Optimal architecture balances complexity and performance**

## 💡 Business Insights

### Customer Segmentation Analysis:
- **High-Risk Demographics:** Customers aged 40+ in Germany
- **Product Usage:** 95% of customers use ≤2 products (low engagement)
- **Financial Indicators:** Customers with >€50K balance show higher churn
- **Activity Level:** Only 51.5% are active members

### Actionable Recommendations:

#### 🎯 Customer Retention Strategies:
1. **Targeted Engagement Programs** for inactive customers
2. **Geographic-Specific Retention** campaigns in Germany
3. **Product Cross-Selling** to increase customer stickiness
4. **Personalized Financial Advisory** for high-balance customers

#### 📊 Operational Improvements:
1. **Proactive Monitoring** of at-risk customer segments
2. **Enhanced Customer Support** channels
3. **Loyalty Rewards Programs** for long-term customers
4. **Regular Customer Satisfaction Surveys**

#### 💰 Expected Impact:
- **Reduce churn rate** by up to 30% through targeted interventions
- **Increase customer lifetime value** via better retention
- **Optimize marketing spend** by focusing on high-risk segments
